Weather forecasting is the process of predicting 
the upcoming state of the atmosphere by analysing current 
weather conditions and using mathematical models to 
simulate future weather patterns. Weather forecasting using 
machine learning involves training models that can 
automatically learn and analyze large amounts of weather 
data to predict future weather patterns. This approach 
involves using a variety of machine learning models, 
including neural networks, decision tree, and support vector 
machines, to analyze historical weather data and generate 
forecasts. The process involves collecting vast amounts of 
data from various sources, including weather stations, 
satellites, and other sensors, to create a comprehensive data 
set for analysis.  Machine learning models can improve the 
accuracy of weather forecasting by detecting patterns in data 
that may not be apparent to humans
